# Performance of Deep Neural Networks on Low-PowerIoT Devices

<b>Chistos Profentzas</b>, Magnus Almgren, and Olaf Landsiedel.


Here we will add soon the source code of perfomance evaluation of the frameworks presented to our paper.

To compile the code arm-gcc is needed 

Makefiles are designed for cortex M with an FPU and DSP. (
